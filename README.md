Among the thousand reasons proving that chat control is a colossal fucking stupidity spewed out by a bunch of certified idiots in the European Union, there’s this: with a shitty browser service – like this crap of 200 lines of code – you can take an image, turn it into pure noise with AES-GCM encryption, and send the encrypted blob plus a key to decrypt it. The receiver, using the same fucking site (or even a local copy), plugs in the key and poof: the image is visible again.
So let’s recap:
- The (fucking) pedophile uploads his folder of disgusting pics, encrypts them, keeps the key, sends it separately.
- His accomplice takes the encrypted files + key and reconstructs the original images.

All with retard-level software that runs offline too – hell, even the dumbest AI could whip up something like this.

So what’s the real goal of the European Union? Protecting kids or ripping off our data to sell it to the highest bidder? 
And keep this in mind: this shitshow project won’t be built by a team of EU programmers with open-source code, but by a fucking private company.

Make your own goddamn conclusions.

Long live the European Union that shoves privacy front and center, bleeding out every programmer with the GDPR just to set up a simple  blog... but then, when it comes to scanning your private messages and handing everything over to a private firm, suddenly privacy can go fuck itself.
